            <p>
                In short, a retaining wall is intended to hold back soil. If you need to create layers of space in a yard or landscaping, a retaining wall may be the answer. <br><br>
                To begin the process, it’s important to get in touch with reputable retaining wall construction companies. There are dozens of materials from which these walls can be built. Plus, what the wall is holding back will change its design. Retaining walls should be approached with the same design and care as you would a bridge. They’re both structures, and they both risk collapse if built incorrectly or with poor materials.

                    <p class="mt-1">If you’re thinking about retaining wall installation, it’s important to figure out exactly what type you might need. For example, a small stone wall intended to break up a yard or lift a garden bed will be vastly different from a large wall intended to keep soil off a highway or parking lot.</p>
                    <p>Your Tacoma retaining wall construction company will have the detailed knowledge to assess your unique space, needs, and budget to design the perfect wall for your area.</p>
                    <h3 class="heading-h3 mt-2">Types of Retaining Walls</h3>
                    <ul class="service-points mt-2">
                        <li><h3 class="bold-text">Gravity Walls</h3>
                            <p>Smaller projects can generally make use of gravity walls. This type uses the force of gravity on the wall itself to hold the soil behind it. There are no further reinforcements or structural supports beyond the wall itself.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><h3 class="bold-text">Reinforced Walls</h3>
                            <p>Larger projects holding heavier loads may need reinforced walls. These walls combine the soil and wall materials together to form a reinforced soil mass. This mass extends into the soil for a bit to provide extra support.</p>
                          </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="heading-h3 mt-1">What Materials Do <span class="point-mark">Retaining Wall Construction Companies Use?</span></h3>
                    <p class="mt-1">Walls can be made out of many different materials! Stone is a popular choice among retaining wall builders, as it is natural and strong. It looks wonderful in most residential and business settings.
                    <br><br>
                    Concrete blocks are another popular retaining wall installation choice. They don’t look as natural, but if your yard or business aesthetic matches that, it will complement very nicely. For example, if you have a patio made of concrete slabs, a concrete wall will blend well.</p>
                    <p>Which material you choose will depend on your space, the pressure the wall needs to hold, and your unique design aesthetic. Your Tacoma retaining wall construction company will have the skills and knowledge to help you choose the perfect material for your needs.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="mt-2 weeding-desc">
                <p>While you can probably handle building a 1-foot wall to hold a garden bed, taller projects that need to hold heavier loads should be left to the professionals. Again, these walls are as structurally complex as bridges, so taking great care with during installation is important. 
                </p>
                <p>  Also, each retaining wall installation will differ significantly due to the materials, placement, and load it must hold.</p>
                <p>All that said, here are the general steps you can expect when beginning a retaining wall construction project in Tacoma: </p>
                <ul class="service-points">
                    <li><p>Your company will perform an inspection of the area and provide an estimate.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Construction begins with digging about 2 feet into the hillside where the wall will go, using landscape fabric to keep dirt from falling back in.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Mark where the wall will go using stakes and a string (the string is about at the top of the wall).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Dig a trench about 2 feet deep for the base. Make sure the floor is level.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Add stones or your material of choice in layers, securing as you go, until you have a wall.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The exact construction of your retaining wall will vary, so be sure to hire a professional company like Pierce Landscapers for your project.

                    <h3>What’s the <span class="point-mark">Value of a Retaining Wall?</span></h3> <br>
                    <p>Retaining walls can be extremely functional for both residential and commercial uses.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="service-points mt-2">
                        <li><h3 class="bold-text">Residential Uses</h3>
                            <p class="mt-1">If you have a hilly property or an area with a slope that you can’t do much with, putting in a retaining wall can make that area functional. Your retaining wall builders can help you turn it into a patio area, a deck, a garden, or anything else that needs flat space.</p>
                            <p> You can also use multiple walls to “terrace” a yard or hill. You can turn these terraces into gardens showcasing a variety of plants or decorative sand/gravel designs.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li><h3 class="bold-text">Commercial Uses</h3>
                            <p class="mt-1">Tacoma retaining wall construction is also frequently used in commercial spaces. Similar to residential use, businesses can turn hillsides functional or display beautiful garden landscaping with retaining walls.</p>
                            <p>Commercial uses also include holding back soil to keep it from overflowing parking lots during rain, improving drainage, or adding aesthetic appeal.</p>
                          </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-1">No matter what type of property you have, adding a retaining wall will boost its value. If you ever need to sell your home or business space, retaining walls are functional ways to improve the chances you’ll get more money during your sale.
