                            <p>Our Pierce County tree removal and land clearing service experts have seen many properties succumb to disease and death because of overgrowth. Rotting trees, stumps, and vegetation can spread diseases to other plants and eventually affect your entire property. It may even spread to neighboring lands! This type of unserviceable property also has a tendency to attract rodents and termites, which can make unhealthy environments worse. Land clearing in Pierce County is essential to the health of your property, cuts down on pests, and refreshes the ecosystem.</p>
