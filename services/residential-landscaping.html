                <p>There are several steps to developing the perfect residential landscaping design for your Tacoma home. From planning and measuring to implementing the final creation, we’ll be there every step of the way.

                        <div>
                            <p class="mt-1">We’ll first need to create a base plan that indicates your property line, house location, and utility locations. This plot will also include the existing plants and other features currently in your space. While it won’t be precisely to scale, this is the base of all future residential landscaping drawings.</p>

                            <p class="mt-1">The next step in our residential landscaping services is a site evaluation that ensures our team knows what already exists on your plot. We’ll also analyze the climatic and soil-related factors that could affect your landscaping decisions.</p>
                            <ul class="service-points">
                                <li><p>Where does the sun shine from?</p></li>
                                <li><p>Is there a lot of wind around your property?</p></li>
                                <li><p>What’s the status and texture of the soil?</p></li>
                                <li><p>Where can water drain properly? </p></li>

                            <p>All of these factors help us decide the best plant types and placement for your home.</p>
                            <p>While conducting a site evaluation, our team may also take into account the architectural style of your home. We want your residential landscaping in Tacoma to blend cohesively with the style of the house — whether it’s rustic, modern, contemporary, or traditional.</p>

                            <p class="mt-1">Every family does different things in their gardens and on their patios. We’ll need to know what goes on outside your home to create the best possible landscape that won’t interfere with your everyday life. Tell us if you want to grow a vegetable garden. Let us know where your kids play. Are you planning to set up a swing set or play park?</p>

                            <p class="mt-1">There are generally three important areas for residential landscaping:</p>
                            <ul class="service-points">
                                <li><p>Public Areas</p></li>
                                <li><p>Living Areas</p></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Public areas for residential landscaping include any part of your yard that’s visible from the street. This could be just your front yard or include driveways, walkways, and front entrances</p>
                            <p>Living areas, or private areas, are usually the most important spaces to develop. These are your side yard or backyard. Our residential landscaping service wants you to feel safe and private here. Many times, we’ll suggest shrubbery or trees to provide a natural screen from the public.</p>
                            <p>Service areas are also important because they’re your storage spaces. This is where you’ll place garbage cans, composting heaps, storage sheds, and other utility needs.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p class="mt-1">After your residential landscaping plan in Tacoma is complete with plant locations and sizes, we’ll move forward with planting and installing your choices. At this point, we’ll be confirming specific plant types to purchase where previously we only discussed simple labels like trees, ground cover, flowers, or shrubs.</p>
