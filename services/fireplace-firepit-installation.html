                say you’ve always dreamed of a fire pit surrounded by gravel, creating a desert-like oasis to unwind. That’s going to be quite different from someone who craves a paved fire pit with green hedges close at hand. Starting with an in-depth conversation about your ideal yard — plus a visual inspection of the space — ensures you get the perfect outdoor fire pit installation experience that will bring you joy for years to come.

                    <p>Your Tacoma retaining wall construction company will have the detailed knowledge to assess your unique space, needs, and budget to design the perfect wall for your area.</p>
                    <h3 class="heading-h3 mt-2">Types of Retaining Walls</h3>
                    <ul class="service-points mt-2">
                        <li>
                            <p>As mentioned, we’ll start with an in-depth conversation about your unique yard and vision.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>Do an inspection of your yard where we carefully measure out the space so we know what we’re working with.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <p>Create a design that incorporates your existing space and how you’d eventually like it to look.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <p>Set a schedule, including a start and end date.</p>

                          <li>
                              <p>Work with you to make sure your installation goes as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
                          </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Because every fire pit installation is different, the inspection phase of the process is key. That’s where we spend most of our time so we can make sure the landscaping we design is perfect from the start.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="mt-2 weeding-desc">
            <p>Hiring a professional landscaper to install a fire ring has a host of benefits! First, because we’re bonded, insured, and licensed, you know you’re getting high-quality work you can count on (more on that below). 
            </p>
            <p>Second, a fire pit adds a space to your home where you can bond with family and friends. Make precious memories, get closer with loved ones, and enjoy the outdoors, all with the simple installation of a fire pit.</p>
            <p>Third, a fire ring instantly adds value to your home. If you ever want to sell your house, it’s a very attractive feature to potential buyers! Especially if you had the pit professionally installed rather than attempting a DIY. Homebuyers trust landscaping companies to get the job done right so they, too, can enjoy the fire pit for years without issue.</p>
