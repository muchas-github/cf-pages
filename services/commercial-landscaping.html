            <p>
            Commercial landscaping is different from residential landscaping because it is wholly for the public. It is a natural extension of your business into horticulture and outdoor design. Your landscaping should reflect your business’s values and personality, as well as delivering sustainability, seasonality, and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>Our commercial landscaping services make both aesthetic and economic sense because we take everything from weather and climate to maintenance and management into consideration when presenting you with a proposal. </p> <br>

                <p class="mt-2">So, other than making your business look prettier, how do our commercial landscaping services benefit you? Our team can help your building look and feel more inviting to customers and guests through the use of plants.</p>
                <p>The right plants can soften the harsh lines and angles of your building, balance a rough landscape, and hide utility boxes and storage areas. Artificial waterscapes, like ponds and fountains, can create a natural feeling inside and outside of your building. Your design can even represent your values! For example, choosing native plants and sustainable design for your commercial landscaping in Pierce County, Washington, can tell people you run a green business without anyone saying a word.</p>

                    <li><p><span>Brick.</span> A timeless option for patio installation for Tacoma climates in particular. Durable, but color may fade over time. Easy to maintain, and will look better than concrete over time. Limited reddish color options.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Tile.</span> Comes in endless bold designs. Keeps feet cool in hot climates. If chipped, artisan tiles may be hard to replace.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Granite.</span> Gorgeous patterns and hues. Chip-, scratch-, and damage-resistant. Extremely durable. Doesn’t fade. Heavy and expensive — should only be installed professionally.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Limestone. Reflects heat; perfect for hot climates and paving around pools. Long-lasting and tough, but it may be expensive.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Slate.</span> Weather-resistant and durable; great for cold climates. Comes in many sleek, neutral colors. Like granite, heavy and should only be installed by a professional.</p></li>
                    <li><p><span>Cast-In-Place or Precast Concrete.</span> One of the most inexpensive options. Comes in endless colors and shapes. Requires low maintenance, but may fade or develop cracks over time.</p></li>

                <p>The first step in our commercial landscaping design process is to meet with you and discuss your vision. Your aesthetic and your needs as a company always come first. Then, based on your preferences, we can make the best suggestions for which plants and features you may want to consider including in your space.

                            <p class="mt-1">When the plotting is complete, our team must evaluate your site to discover which plants best fit the space. The climate, current soil factors, and water drainage are all critical elements we need to explore. Each of these factors helps our commercial landscaping team make suggestions and give advice.</p>

                            <p>Your internal areas are where your team eats lunch or takes breaks. You may want to include garden walkways, sitting spots, and shaded locations to create an enjoyable atmosphere.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, there are use areas where you store maintenance materials, place dumpsters, and have HVAC and electrical boxes. We may want to shield these areas from the public with a shrubbery or tree screen.</p>

                            <p>During this time, you can make specific plant requests or simply approve our suggestions.
