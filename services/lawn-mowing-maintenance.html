                <h2>Service Based on <span>Grass Type & Length</span></h2>
                <p>You might be thinking that you should schedule your Tacoma lawn mowing and maintenance based on how often your grass needs it. However, lawn maintenance is really about how much grass you cut as opposed to how often. Mowing your lawn too short or too frequently can lead to weak roots and brown spots in your grass.
                The white part of a blade of grass is usually the most delicate and tender. If it’s exposed to the sun, it may burn and brown very easily, leaving you with an unsightly lawn. On the other end of the spectrum, if your grass is too long, it can get smothered or grow mold that results in similarly dead grass. <br><br>
                Luckily, our lawn service experts in Tacoma know exactly how to treat your grass. We use some basic guidelines to determine how we treat your lawn based on grass length and type. In Washington, we typically work with Kentucky bluegrass, fine-leaf fescues, perennial ryegrass, and bentgrasses, but we have experience with all types of lawn grasses!

                        <p class="mt-1">A longer grass blade has roots that are well-established and grow deeper. This length of grass does best with twice-weekly mowing with lower mower blades. Each session takes off nearly ⅓ of the length of the grass to ensure it’s the optimal length. If a lawn specialist removes more than ⅓ of the blade, it can cause damage. It’s better to have more frequent sessions with less cutting to ensure the health of your lawn.</p>

                    <p>Part of our consultation with you will determine the ideal mowing schedule for your lawn. Once we know what type of grass you have and how long you want to keep it, we can recommend the frequency of our visits. You’ll generally need our lawn mowing services in Tacoma, WA more often during the growing season — once or twice a week on average. During the cooler seasons, when grass grows less, we’ll adjust your schedule for the new rate of growth.</p>
                    <p>One major consideration that will impact our Tacoma lawn mowing schedule is the grass’s hydration level. We prefer not to mow grass when it’s wet because it can damage our mowers and cause bare spots to emerge. During the rainy season, we’ll have to find days to come when the grass is dry.</p>
