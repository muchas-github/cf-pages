                Brush hogging is when you cut back on overgrown flora, like trees and vegetation, to promote environmental health. While you might think this is similar to standard tree removal services or bulldozing, this sort of landscaping service doesn’t agitate the earth around the area. With our brush hogging services in Tacoma, there is no invasive root extraction or other environmental disruption. Once we clear your land, the soil has enough nutrients to nourish other plants for a healthier ecosystem. Clearing away the brush can even have a positive effect on neighboring properties!

                   <p class="section-p mt-1">Field mowing and brush hogging are a form of rotary mowing. Our machines attach to the back of a tractor or mower and utilize the engine of the vehicle to level the growth of grass and tall saplings as we ride it across the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-p">You might think this sounds similar to a regular lawnmower. However, the brush hogging machine differs from a mower in several ways. For one, the brush hogging machine doesn’t have fixed blades. Instead, it has blades that shift on hinges that allow them to rotate and bounce when they come in contact with fixed items they cannot cut. With this bounce-back motion that moves the blades back and inwards, even if our machine blades hit rocks or massive trees, they’ll rotate to continue moving over the vegetation instead of getting stuck.</p>

                <p>How often you choose to utilize our brush hogging services depends on the size of the area you need to maintain and how you plan on using it. When it comes to areas used for hunting and pastures, we recommend cutting through the brush every six months to a year. If any of your flora grow more quickly, you may want to consider having someone come out every three to six months, as sometimes trees get too big and need to be dug out by hand.</p>
