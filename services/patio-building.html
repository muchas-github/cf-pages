                There are hundreds of paving stones out there for Tacoma patio installation projects, and each has its own unique look and attributes. The material of your patio, whether it’s paving stones, tiles, or bricks, will have a significant impact on the style, longevity, maintenance, and weather resistance of your patio.
            </p>
            <p>We highly recommend you consult our paving stones guide for a more in-depth look at the types of materials you can use for your patio or walkway. Here’s a brief overview of the options you have. </p> <br>

                        <li><p><span>Brick.</span> A timeless option for patio installation for Tacoma climates in particular. Durable, but color may fade over time. Easy to maintain, and will look better than concrete over time. Limited reddish color options.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span>Tile.</span> Comes in endless bold designs. Keeps feet cool in hot climates. If chipped, artisan tiles may be hard to replace.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span>Granite.</span> Gorgeous patterns and hues. Chip-, scratch-, and damage-resistant. Extremely durable. Doesn’t fade. Heavy and expensive — should only be installed professionally.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Limestone. Reflects heat; perfect for hot climates and paving around pools. Long-lasting and tough, but it may be expensive.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span>Slate.</span> Weather-resistant and durable; great for cold climates. Comes in many sleek, neutral colors. Like granite, heavy and should only be installed by a professional.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span>Cast-In-Place or Precast Concrete.</span> One of the most inexpensive options. Comes in endless colors and shapes. Requires low maintenance, but may fade or develop cracks over time.</p></li>

            <p>We mentioned above that certain stones are bad for cold or wet climates. Due to the rainy climate in Tacoma, patio installation safety should be a top priority. There is one solution you can try to get a stone you really want in virtually any climate: slip-resistant coatings. 
            </p>
            <p>Slip-resistant coatings work especially well on concrete. Concrete is notoriously slippery when it’s wet or icy, especially if your area is prone to black ice. The coatings are slip-resistant, meaning they’ll increase your friction significantly to prevent slips, but they naturally can’t prevent everything. These coatings are often cost-effective, so they’re a great option to consider during the patio landscaping process.</p>

            <div class="mt-2 weeding-desc">
                <p>If you’re a savvy DIYer and you have a considerable amount of time to devote to installing the patio, then you could potentially take on a simple patio project. However, as professionals with years of experience with patio installation in Tacoma, we’ve seen many DIY pitfalls that lead to significant drainage problems, uneven placing, wonky appearances, and even property damage. 
                </p>
                <p><span>Important to note:</span> The cost of undoing a poorly-made patio and getting it professionally reconstructed is going to cost you far more time, stress, and money than if you’d hired a professional in the first place.</p>
                <p>If you’re still confident about your skills and you think you can install a patio yourself, take these tips into account:</p>
                <ul class="service-points mt-2">

                                <p><span>Don’t skimp on the underlayers.</span> Your patio will only be as good as the gravel and sand base beneath it and how well it’s tamped down.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <p><span>Use a level.</span> You don’t want a crooked, sinking patio. Uneven stones or bricks can trip someone and cause an injury. If your ground is uneven, you may need special equipment to level it.</p>
                                </li>
                        </div>

                                <p><span>Choose the right for your climate.</span> Certain stones can get too hot in warm climates, and likewise, some stones are bad for keeping a safe grip in the winter. Ask a local expert for Tacoma patio installation assistance if you aren’t sure.</p>
                                </li>

                                <p><span>Do your research.</span> Watch YouTube videos, read articles, and get professional or friendly advice if you can.</p>

                <p class="mt-1">If you’re building an elaborate patio that you want to stand the test of time, we highly recommend spending a little bit more to get it installed professionally. A professional can do more elaborate and attractive designs, and they can ensure the surface looks neat, has suitable drainage, and lasts for a long time. Patios have a nice return on investment for your property, and hiring a professional helps maximize that potential.
